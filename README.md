## 3. 🎬 Movie Dataset Analysis

**Objective:**  
Analyze a curated movie dataset to understand patterns in genre popularity, budget vs. revenue relationships, and key success drivers in the film industry.

**Key Steps:**
- Explored trends in movie genres, ratings, and release patterns
- Investigated correlation between budget, revenue, and vote counts
- Identified high-performing movies by multiple metrics
- Used visual storytelling to present industry patterns

**Skills Applied:**
- Data preprocessing  
- Feature engineering (e.g., extracting year, genre parsing)  
- Correlation and trend analysis  
- Data visualization with Seaborn  

**Outcome:**  
Revealed that while higher budgets can contribute to success, vote count and genre play significant roles in a movie's popularity and profitability.
